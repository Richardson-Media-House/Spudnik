If you are hosting an instance of Spudnik yourself, please make sure it is for private use only in your own Discord servers. Do not make it a public bot, advertise it as your own, or list it on public sites. We will make sure it is taken down as an impostor.

Instead, fork the bot and contribute! Ongoing contributors will be invited to join the team and help grow the community!
